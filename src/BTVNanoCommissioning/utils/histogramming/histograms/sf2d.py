# 40s/50s code numbering; only the HFvLF/BvC cut values differ
# (utils/selection.py btag_wp_dict). phase4 is the re-optimised NoPIDParT
# scheme from SFbc-2D/OptimizedWP/results/phase4_scheme_NoPIDParT.json, which
# renumbers its 11 categories densely as 0..10. There is deliberately no
# phase4 entry for UParT: that optimisation was only ever run for NoPIDParT.

# numbering (C0..C4 = 40..44, B0..B4 = 50..54) "at least Bk"/"at least Ck" is

# no b/c tightness ordering of their own). Only the B2+/C2+ cells (x4,
# y6-8 -> {8,9,10}; x4, y1-3 -> {1,3,5}) have an unambiguous geometric
# equivalent to a legacy cumulative threshold; B1/B3/B4/C1/C3/C4 do not, and
# phase4 has no calibrated single-tag WP to fall back on either
# (utils/selection.py's `_mapping_phase4` docstring: "no dedicated single-tag
# b/c WPs exist for this tagger"). Inventing a phase4 B1+/B3+/... here would
# repeat exactly the mistake that comment warns against, so those keys are
# deliberately absent for nopid_phase4 -- callers must check for the key.
